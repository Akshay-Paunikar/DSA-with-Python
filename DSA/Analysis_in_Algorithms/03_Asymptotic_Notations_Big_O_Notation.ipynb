    "    - If the algorithm runs for the same amount of time every time irrespective of the input size. It is said to exhibit constant time complexity.\n",

    " - <b>2. Logarithmic Time Complexity O(log n):</b>\n",
    "    - When the algorithm runtime increases very slowly compared to an increase in input size i.e. logarithm of input size then the algorithm is said to exhibit logarithmic time complexity.\n",
    "    - It is denoted by O(log n).\n",
    "    - Example: Binary Search Algorithm\n",

    " - <b>3. Linear Time Complexity O(n):</b>\n",
    "    - If the algorithm runtime is linearly proportional to the input size then the algorithm is said to exhibit linear time complexity.\n",

    "    - Example: Linear Searching Algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    " - <b>4. Quadratic Time Complexity O(n<sup>2</sup>):</b>\n",
    "    - Quadratic time complexity is when the runtime scales quadratically with the input. As the input size increases, the runtime of the algorithm also increases in a quadratic fashion (i.e. the runtime is proportional to the square of the input size).\n",
    "    - It is denoted by O(n<sup>2</sup>).\n",
    "    - Example: Sorting Algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    " - <b>5. Cubic Time Complexity O(n<sup>3</sup>):</b>\n",
    "    - Cubic time complexity means that the running time of an algorithm is proportional to the cube of the input size.\n",
    "    - It is denoted by O(n<sup>3</sup>).\n",
    "    - Example: matrix multiplication algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    " - <b>6. Polynomial Time Complexity O(n<sup>C</sup>):</b>\n",
    "    - Polynomial time complexity refers to the time complexity of an algorithm that can be expressed as a polynomial function of the input size n.\n",
    "    - In Big O notation, an algorithm is said to have polynomial time complexity if its time complexity is O(n<sup>C</sup>), where C is a constant (C > 0) and represents the degree of the polynomial.\n",
