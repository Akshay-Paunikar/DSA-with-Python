    "<h3>What is a Data Structure?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    " - A data structure is the mathematical or logical model of an organization of data. \n",
    " - A data structure is a way to organize data in a form that is accessible to computers. \n",
    " - It allows the processing of a large amount of data in a relatively short period of time. \n",
    " - The main purpose of using data structures is to reduce time and space complexities. \n",
    " - An efficient data structure makes use of minimum memory space and takes the minimal possible time to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    " <h4>Types of Data Structure:</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    " - <b>Arrays: </b>An array is a collection of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations.\n",
    " - <b>Linked Lists: </b>It is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations and the elements are linked with each other.\n",
    " - <b>Stacks: </b>Follow LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. In this the last element in the stack will be removed first.\n",
    " - <b>Queues: </b>It follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. In this the first element stored is removed first.\n",
    " - <b>Hash Tables: </b>This is a type of data structure that stores values which have keys related to each item.\n",
    " - <b>Trees: </b>It is a data structure in which data is organized hierarchically and linked together. Some examples are the Binary Search Tree, Binary Tree, Splay Tree, AVL Tree etc.\n",
    " - <b>Heaps: </b>It is a specialized tree-based data structure, also called binary heap in which the tree is a complete binary tree and the data is stored.\n",
    " - <b>Graphs: </b>It consists of a set of nodes and edges connecting each other."
