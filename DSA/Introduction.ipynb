    "<h3>What is a Data Structure?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    " - A data structure is the mathematical or logical model of an organization of data. \n",
    " - A data structure is a way to organize data in a form that is accessible to computers. \n",
    " - It allows the processing of a large amount of data in a relatively short period of time. \n",
    " - The main purpose of using data structures is to reduce time and space complexities. \n",
    " - An efficient data structure makes use of minimum memory space and takes the minimal possible time to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    " <h4>Types of Data Structure:</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    " - <b>Arrays: </b>An array is a collection of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations.\n",
    " - <b>Linked Lists: </b>It is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations and the elements are linked with each other.\n",
    " - <b>Stacks: </b>Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. Follow LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. In this the last element in the stack will be removed first.\n",
    " - <b>Queues: </b>It follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. In this the first element stored is removed first.\n",
    " - <b>Hash Tables: </b>This is a type of data structure that stores values which have keys related to each item.\n",
    " - <b>Trees: </b>It is a data structure in which data is organized hierarchically and linked together. Some examples are the Binary Search Tree, Binary Tree, Splay Tree, AVL Tree etc.\n",
    " - <b>Heaps: </b>A Heap is a complete binary tree data structure that satisfies the heap property: for every node, the value of its children is less than or equal to its own value.\n",
    " - <b>Graphs: </b>A Graph is a non-linear data structure. It consists of a set of nodes and edges connecting each other.\n",
    " - <b>String :</b>A string is a sequence of characters, typically used to represent text. It is considered a data type that allows for the manipulation and processing of textual data in computer programs.\n",
    " - <b>Matrix/Grid: <b>A matrix is a two-dimensional array of elements, arranged in rows and columns. It is represented as a rectangular grid, with each element at the intersection of a row and column."

    "<h3>What is Algorithm?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    " - Algorithms are well-defined sets of instructions that are used to solve problems or perform a task.\n",
    " - An algorithm is a sequence of instructions or actions that are performed within a limited amount of space-time to provide a solution to a particular issue.\n",
    " - It is a systematic and logical approach to tackle or overcome an issue by the step-by-step process to start from scratch and develop a solution.\n",
    " - In simpler terms, it is a set of operations performed in a step-by-step manner to execute a task."
