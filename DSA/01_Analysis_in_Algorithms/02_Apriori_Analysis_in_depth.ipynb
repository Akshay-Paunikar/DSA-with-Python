    "<b>What do you mean by Apriori Analysis?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    " - It is an analysis which helps us to find which solution is best among all.\n",
    " - It is a \"Determination of order of magnitude of a statement\".\n",
    " - Here magnitude means: while running a program, how many times a statement is executing.\n",
    " - For example: If you want to print value of x 10 times, you can write print(x) 10 times and get the output. This is a very tedious task. So, what we will do is we will use a for loop and achieve the same output with minimum lines of code.\n",
    " - Now, if someone asks what is the time complexity of above lines of code??. Since, we printed x 10 number of times, it is order of 10 i.e. O(10), the Big O Notation.\n",
    " - Big O Notation takes care of the worst case time complexity.\n",
    " - Let's take another example:\n",
    "\n",
    "y = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "z = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "x = y + z\n",
    "\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "- In above lines of code, each statement is running only one time. So, the time complexity is constant i.e. O(1). Hence, the code will take very minimum time to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another example is:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "for i = 0 to n:\n",
    "\n",
    "    for j = 0 to n:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        x = y + z</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    " - Here, what will happen is: for i = 0, it will run from j = 0 to n and will perform the operation x = y + z each time. Then, for i = 1, it will run from j = 0 to n and will perform the same operation x = y + z each time and so on till i = n.\n",
    "\n",
    " - So, here code will run for n * n = n<sup>2</sup> times. The time complexity will be: n<sup>2</sup> + n + 1.\n",
    "\n",
    " - As, this is a apriori analysis, we are expecting an approximate output. Consider n<sup>2</sup> + n + 1. For higher values of n, what matters is the n<sup>2</sup> i.e. the highest polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    " - So, the overall time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>) approximately.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Let's say that the value of n is 2000. Then, the value of n + 1 is very small as compared to n<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, we use approximate when we talk about apriori algorithm."
