    "A heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property (min-heap or max-heap). In a min-heap, the parent node is always smaller than or equal to its children. In a max-heap, the parent node is always larger than or equal to its children. Heaps are usually used to implement priority queues, where the smallest (or largest) element is always at the root of the tree.\n",
